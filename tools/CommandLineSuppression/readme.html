    <h2>Overview</h2>
    This tool is a command-line utility that allows a user to add/edit/delete alert suppressions.  It
    works by making a web request to the suppression portal.

    This tool relies on the ActiveState "perlapp" compiler to create pre-compiled Perl navtive binaries. 
    This approach compiles all the dependent packages into one script so we don't have to worry about
    the what perl packages are available on each machine.
