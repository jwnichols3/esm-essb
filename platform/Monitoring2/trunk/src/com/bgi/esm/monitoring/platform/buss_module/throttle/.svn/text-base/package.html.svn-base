                    In the original system, each discrete OVO event is processed atomically, in periods of peak
                    activity the responsible administrator may receive literally thousands 
                    of trouble tickets all with the same root cause (such as a file system
                    failure, which causes all dependent applications to generate alarms).

                    The goal of simple throttling is to modulate the OVO event stream and ensure 
                    that in situations of peak alert activity system monitoring is assisting rather 
                    than distracting the infrastructure team.

                    <br>
                    Throttling monitors the activity level and determines the appropriate 
                    action based upon user defined rules.  In the above scenario, after 
                    certain conditions were satisfied, the alarms could be collected in a
                    database whose contents could be accessed using a web browser.  Rather
                    than dismiss each redundant message individually, the operator can
                    concentrate on damage control.  The database hosted trouble log would
                    also be available for post mortem analysis.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Simple throttling classifies activity into "storm levels" by user defined
                    rules.  Each storm level can have multiple rules ("rule set") specifying 
                    behavior and rules can specify overlapping behavior.  Conditions which 
                    match multiple rules are arbitrated by consulting the rule priority.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Storm Levels" is user defined by the following parameters:
                    1) message group (joins w/OVO message and data map rule)
                    2) priority (AKA "storm level", tie breaker, must be unique integer)
                    3) duration (window in seconds)
                    4) threshold (message count)
                    5) action (passthru, spool, discard)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Use case:
                    Consider the message group "test group" which has the following rules:
                    Storm Level:0, Duration:30 seconds, Threshold:0   messages, Action:PassThru
                    Storm Level:1, Duration:90 seconds, Threshold:100 messages, Action:Spool
                    Storm Level:2, Duration:90 seconds, Threshold:300 messages, Action:Discard
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This says for calm weather (level 0) messages are simply forwarded to the 
                    dispatcher module (current OVO/AP/SC behavior).  Every rule set has at 
                    least a level zero rule as default.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If there are over 100 messages observed in any 90 second window, then a
                    storm level 1 is declared and messages are now written to a database.
                    Dispatcher will be sent summary messages that the storm has started, 
                    when it has ended and periodic notices that a storm is still in progress.
                    The summary messages will contain the URL where storm messages can be
                    accessed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If there are over 300 messages in 90 seconds, then a storm level 2 is 
                    declared.  OVO messages are discarded and, but dispatcher will still
                    receive summary messages regarding storm start, storm end and storm in
                    progress.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Implementation:
                    Throttle retains a hashmap which contains an object for each message group.
                    As each message arrives, the supporting object is retrieved and the message
                    processed according to the last calculated storm level.  Note that message
                    arrival does not cause any storm calculations.
