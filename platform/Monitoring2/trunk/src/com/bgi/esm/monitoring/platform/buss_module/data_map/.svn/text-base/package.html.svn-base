    Data Map Buss Module.

    <p>
    The data map buss module is the second module (from OVO).  
    This module awaits messages from the suppression module and 
    usually forwards messages to the throttle module.

    <p>
    Based upon the message group field within the OVO ticket message,
    the data map selects the supporting alarm point/peregrine rule
    and forwards this information to the throttle module.

    <p>
    Messages which fail to match a data map rule are logged as errors
    and not forwarded to throttle.

    <p>
    Data map rules are kept within a database table.
