    Data Map Buss Module.

    <p>
    The data map buss module is the second module (from OVO).  
    This module awaits messages from the suppression module and 
    usually forwards messages to the throttle module.

    <p>
    Based upon the message group field within the OVO ticket message,
    the data map selects the supporting alarm point/peregrine rule
    and forwards this information to the throttle module.

    <p>
    Messages which fail to match a data map rule are logged as errors
    and not forwarded to throttle.

    <p>
    Kill messages are forwarded to throttle and then cause the
    data map buss module to exit.

    <p>
    Data map rules are kept in a file specified within the system
    configuration.  There is a thread (RuleManager) which polls
    the rule file and reloads when updated.
