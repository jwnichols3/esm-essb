    Suppression Buss Module.

    <p>
    The suppression buss module is the first module (from OVO).
    This module awais messages from OVO and takes the "first cut" 
    at deciding if the message should be suppressed or processed
    by downstream modules.

    <p>
    Suppression decisions are based upon an external "rules" file.
    Maintenance of the rules file provided by other applications
    which existed prior to this project.  "RuleManager" is threaded
    and polls the external file for updates.
    

    <p>
    Messages which should be suppressed are written back to OVO
    for acknowledgement.

    <p>
    Messages which should not be suppressed are forwarded to the
    data map module.
